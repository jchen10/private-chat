  <h1>Private Chat</h1>

<pre>
   This application provides a framework for multi-party 'chat' conversations, with a significant degree
   of confidence that your conversations will be PRIVATE! This is accomplished in the following manner:

      The application and socket-server are hosted on your own private server, behind a firewall.
      This private server should only expose/forward a single port (81). All users will need to
      know the IP address/port# in advance.

      All names and messages are encripted with a fairly strong encription method. This encription
      is based on a mutually agreed upon 'passcode'. Each user must know in advamce, both the passcode,
      and the IP-address:port# of the server. This passcode is entered each time a new socket-client starts.
      A passcode is never locally cached or sent out on the wire. All messages are transmitted over the
      socket connection in an encripted form. Client Apps can view unencripted text only if they have
      entered the correct passcode. Otherwise only mangled text will be displayed.

      Encripted messages are never unencripted or cached on the server. The server has no knowledge of
      the app or messages. It simply relays each encripted message to all registered clients.

      Messages are never saved/cached on the client or the server. They are simply added as 'li' tags
      on each clients web-page. These HtmlElements containing the decoded messages, are locally created
      and never exposed to the network or the server.

      Although Your browser will likely cache the app files sent from the server, it will never cache
      the added 'li' elements that are created in real-time by the app. When the page closes, the added
      elements will be disposed without a trace.

      Even if your internet connection is being monitored, a packet sniffer will only see encripted
      socket messages.  Although the encription is capable of being broken by brute-force passcode
      trials, a frequent passcode change would prevent this. Only a goverment agency with billion dollar
      servers, directly sniffing your private connection to this server, would be able to eventually
      decode your private messages.

   The point is, you are not using public servers/services that may be routinely monitored and cached
   by the service provider. This service-provider caching is known to be provided to government agencies
   for realtime and/or historical analysis.

   NOTE: This app would NOT prevent someone with unathorized access to
   your device from examining the browsers DOM, or capturing keystrokes.

   Example of messages sent by server:

    {"type":"RegisterChatter","data":{"id":"lgODawGlzp","name":"lSo4I37vTm0="}}
    {"type":"RegisterChatter","data":{"id":"lCN1WNOMA7","name":"5dpelPRGIbI="}}
    {"type":"chat-message","data":{"id":"lCN1WNOMA7","name":"5dpelPRGIbI=","msg":"tq0uoSfrf5g=","color":"green"}}
    {"type":"chat-message","data":{"id":"lgODawGlzp","name":"lSo4I37vTm0=","msg":"lg2zm5v7fHc=","color":"red"}}
    {"type":"chat-message","data":{"id":"lCN1WNOMA7","name":"5dpelPRGIbI=","msg":"9R9Og2FGrUE=","color":"green"}}
    {"type":"chat-message","data":{"id":"lgODawGlzp","name":"lSo4I37vTm0=","msg":"ZKGNz1+xus93X9hvSe7v6w==","color":"red"}}
